Here are the files associated with Tamariz, Papa, Cristea & McGuigan (in prep):

1. The experimental data
2. An R file with the statistical analysis of the experimental data
3. Two simulations to estimate parameter values, one with 2 parameters (expert/peer bias and congruence/incongruence bias) and one with three parameters (the two mentioned, plus primacy/recency bias)
